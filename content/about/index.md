# About Me

Hello! 

I have recently graduated with a MA in philosophy and thought I'd share with you some of the works I've written during my studies. My primary points of interest were philosophy of art, existentialism (especially Camus), and the metaphysics of personal identity. 

I hope you find these interesting and that they inspire further philosophical inquisition.
